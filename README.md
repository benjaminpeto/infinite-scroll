# infinite-scroll
This app will showcase random photos from unSplash on a simple web page built with JavaScript. I am practicing using APIs, and JavaScript functions and methods to making a page seamlessly load more pictures to the users by scrolling down to the bottom.

Added .gitignore to hide my API key, and .DS_Store before I comitted to github.

To use, you have to get your own API key and account here --> https://unsplash.com/join

Have fun!
