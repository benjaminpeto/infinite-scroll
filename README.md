# infinite-scroll
This app will showcase random photos from unSplash on a simple web page built with JavaScript. I am practicing using APIs, and JavaScript functions and methods to making a page seamlessly load more pictures to the users by scrolling down to the bottom.

Also added .gitignore to hide API key, and .DS_Store before I committed to github.
